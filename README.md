# Rocket.Chat Integration Demo

This repository contains two applications—a client and a server—that demonstrate a simple integration with [Rocket.Chat](https://rocket.chat). The server handles backend operations, while the client provides a basic interface for interaction with the Rocket.Chat API. Both applications are set up for easy installation and execution using `npm`.

## Features

- **Client App**: A frontend app running on port 4000 that interacts with the Server App. It provides register, login and home pages.
- **Server App**: A backend app running on port 3030 that interacts with Rocket.Chat server and handles client requests.
- **Simple Setup**: Get both applications running with `npm install` and `npm start`.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v20.17)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)

You will also need access to a self-hosted instance of Rocket.Chat running on port 3000
